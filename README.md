# ScalaLinkedListRealisation
Here I wrote my own LinkedList class which can add, remove, find elements. There are point type and integer can be stored in here. It was realized by using generic in LinkedListRealisation class.
Also linked list can be sorted by merge because of comparators for each object. Was written GUI for work and testing of linked list.
